# Async

__A higher-order component for rendering data that isn't ready yet.__

There are plenty of situations where you need to fetch content to be displayed, but want
to show some sort of loading graphic in the interim. This component helps to simplify
that pattern by handling common types of promises and providing a simple mechanism
for materializing the resolved data into JSX.


## Props

> Note: only top-level props are in the README, for the full list check out the [website](http://boundless.js.org/Async#props).

### Required Props

There are no required props.


### Optional Props

- __`contentRenderedFunc`__ ・ a callback for when real content has been rendered; either normal passed data or when a passed promise resolves

  Expects | Default Value
  -       | -
  `function` | `() => {}`

- __`convertToJSXFunc`__ ・ a function that takes the resolved payload of a promise provided by `props.data` and returns renderable JSX; defaults to trying to render the resolved value of the Promise

  Expects | Default Value
  -       | -
  `function` | `(x) => x`

- __`data`__ ・ a promise, or some other piece of data to be run through `props.convertToJSXFunc`

  Expects | Default Value
  -       | -
  `any` | `null`

- __`errorContent`__ ・ content to be shown if the promise is rejected

  Expects | Default Value
  -       | -
  `any renderable` | `'⚠️'`

- __`loadingContent`__ ・ content to be shown while the promise is in pending state

  Expects | Default Value
  -       | -
  `any renderable` | `null`
