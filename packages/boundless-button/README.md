# Button
__A control with "pressed" state support.__

> The Boundless Team recommends reviewing the [Button](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/
UserExperience/Conceptual/OSXHIGuidelines/ControlsButtons.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000957-CH48-SW2) section of
the Apple Human Interface Guidelines for inspiration of design patterns and optimal usage of `Button` in your
project.

Button can be used like a normal HTML `<button>`, or when provided `props.pressed`, can become stateful. Think of a stateful button as more of a "toggle", like turning on bold-mode in a rich text editor.

### Interactions

Type | Context | Expectation
---- | ------- | -----------
__Keyboard__ | `[Enter, Space]` (unpressed) | trigger the `onPressed` handler
__Keyboard__ | `[Enter, Space]` (pressed) | trigger the `onUnpressed` handler
__Mouse__ | `click` (unpressed) | trigger the `onPressed` handler
__Mouse__ | `click` (pressed) | trigger the `onUnpressed` handler

### Props

_Note: only top-level props are in the README, for the full list check out the [website](http://boundless.js.org/Button#props)._

Name | Type | Description | Required | Default Value
---- | ---- | ----------- | -------- | -------------
children | `node` |  | false | `null`
onClick | `func` |  | false | `noop`
onPressed | `func` | called when the element becomes "pressed" or triggered by the user (mouse or keyboard); backing data must be updated to persist the state change; this function will still be called if `props.pressed` is not passed | false | `noop`
onUnpressed | `func` | called when the element becomes "unpressed"; backing data must be updated to persist the state change | false | `noop`
pressed | `bool` | enables "pressed" support and adds the `aria-pressed` attribute to the `.b-button` node; essentially a "stateful" button (see the "unpressed/pressed" example demo above) | false | `undefined`
