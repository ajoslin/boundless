# Modal
__A blocking, focus-stealing container.__

Modal is an enhancement upon [Dialog](boundless-dialog/README.md). Typically, a masking layer is provided to obscure the rest of the page in some fashion, while also blocking outside click and keystroke access until the modal is dismissed.

> The UIKit Team recommends reviewing the [Alerts](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/OSXHIGuidelines/WindowAlerts.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000957-CH44-SW1) section of the Apple Human Interface Guidelines for inspiration of design patterns and optimal usage of `Modal` in your project.

__Modal supports all [Dialog props](boundless-dialog/README.md#available-props); applied to the `.ui-modal` node__
