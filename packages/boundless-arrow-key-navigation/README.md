# ArrowKeyNavigation
__A higher-order component for arrow key navigation on a grouping of children.__

ArrowKeyNavigation is designed not to care about the component types it is wrapping. Due to this, you can pass
whatever HTML tag you like into `props.component` or even a React component you've made elsewhere. Additional
props passed to `<ArrowKeyNavigation ...>` will be forwarded on to the component or HTML tag name you've supplied.

The children, similarly, can be any type of component.

### Interactions

Type | Context | Expectation
---- | ------- | -----------
__Keyboard__ | ⬅️ `Left` | move focus to previous child if `props.mode` is `ArrowKeyNavigation.mode.HORIZONTAL` or `ArrowKeyNavigation.mode.BOTH`
__Keyboard__ | ➡️ `Right` | move focus to next child if `props.mode` is `ArrowKeyNavigation.mode.HORIZONTAL` or `ArrowKeyNavigation.mode.BOTH`
__Keyboard__ | ⬆️ `Up` | move focus to previous child if `props.mode` is `ArrowKeyNavigation.mode.VERTICAL` or `ArrowKeyNavigation.mode.BOTH`
__Keyboard__ | ⬇️ `Down` | move focus to next child if `props.mode` is `ArrowKeyNavigation.mode.VERTICAL` or `ArrowKeyNavigation.mode.BOTH`

### Props

_Note: only top-level props are in the README, for the full list check out the [website](http://boundless.js.org/ArrowKeyNavigation#props)._

Name | Type | Description | Required | Default Value

defaultActiveChildIndex | `number` | Allows for a particular child to be initially reachable via tabbing | false | `0`
mode | `enum([ArrowKeyNavigation.mode.HORIZONTAL, ArrowKeyNavigation.mode.VERTICAL, ArrowKeyNavigation.mode.BOTH])` | Controls when arrow key presses will be caught by component and result in the active item being incremented or decremented | false | `ArrowKeyNavigation.mode.BOTH`
