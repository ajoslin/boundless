# FittedText
__Fit given text inside a parent container, obeying implict and explicit constraints.__

The most common use case for this class is fitting single-line text of unknown/variable length into a button or heading with finite boundaries.

and optimal  * usage of `FittedText` in your project.

### Interactions

There are no expected user interactions. The component emits normal text and merely changes the presentation; accessibility is not obstructed.

### Props
