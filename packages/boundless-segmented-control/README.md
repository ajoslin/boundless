# SegmentedControl
__A control containing multiple buttons, only one of which can be active at a time.__

SegmentedControl is implemented as a "controlled component", meaning it is a direct representation of the model data passed inside. User interaction will bubble changes in the form of `onOptionSelected` that a controller view must intercept and apply against the data provider.

## Props

_Note: only top-level props are in the README, for the full list check out the [website](http://boundless.js.org/SegmentedControl#props)._
