## UIKit

UIKit is a problem-solving component pack, meant to provide implementations for common UI needs that would generally be considered annoying to implement yourself. Each component is designed with maximum extensibility in mind, with _at least_ basic screen-reader / ARIA support.

The library intentionally does not come with styles to remain lightweight, but see the `demo/` folder of each component for reference and inspiration when writing your own.
